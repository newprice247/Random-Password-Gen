# Random-Password-Gen: Module 3 Challenge

## Description

The goal of this project was to build a random password generator using JavaScript and the provided starter code. The application enables the user to generate a random password based on criteria that they have selected using the web app's built in questionare. Based on their choices, a random password of varying length, using a variety of different types of characteres, will be displayed dynamically on screen.

## Finished Project

### Comments

* When the generate button is clicked in the browser, a prompt window will display asking the user to specify a password length, which must be between 8 and 128 characters.
* If the user specifies a number less than 8 or greater than 128 an alert window displays asking the user to try again and the questionare resets.
* As the questionare continues, the user will choose if they want a variety of different characters including numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters(ex. @#$%@!).
* If the user doesn't choose any of the characters provided, an alert window displays to inform the user to choose at least one, and the questionare resets.
* Based on the user's chosen characters and password length, a random password will be generated and displayed on screen in the empty container above the generate button.
